Blizzard had accidentally opened public access to their overwatch stats api (https://api.overwatchleague.com), but has since closed it.

There is no other official source for Overwatch stats, so unless I turn this into a past stats (for the previous years' leagues), it just won't be possible until Blizzard opens the API back up.
